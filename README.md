This project is about Amazon’s co-purchase network; i.e., which products are purchased together. There are two data files available: “products.csv” and “copurchase.csv”. 

“products.csv” contains the information about the products. 
“copurchase.csv” contains the co-purchase information (i.e., if people bought one product, then they also co-purchased the other).
